        Talking about the impact pf cloud Computing is almost the same as talking about an complete change on society in general. His most impact was obviously on companies around the world, imagine nowdays having to buy hundreds of dollars in servers just to store files for an Company that receives losts of files every day and that will probably have no use after some time. Thanks to cloud computing this changed, is way easier to storage and access any file thanks to it, and not just only that but also helps new companies to grow better, since they don't have to pay lots of money to buy servers this money can be invested in other areas. Not only on companies but it also chage many other areas, like in hospitals. Is way easier to an medic to access people's files and documents without needing an second person to check for them making the job way longer. The cloud is also important on studies, having teacher's to send the lessons online to every student to check everytime they need is an great advance, this has been used constantly in the pandemic since no one was able to go to face-to-face classes, imagine having to pass all the pandemic without the help of cloud computing.
