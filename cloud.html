        Cloud computing is a term that has revolutionized the way companies and people are benefiting from technology. For many years companies and people needed to invest in software, hardware and other services. With the rise of cloud computing companies most companies get access to this scalable and practically ready infrastructure at an affordable price.
        Many people have had contact with cloud computing and maybe they didn't even realize it, we use streaming services, photo and video storage services. Another example would be Google online services like google docs, google meet and even google calendar, without even having any software installed on your machine or cell phone.

    All the examples shown so far are about a flexible structure that can be adapted according to demand. These structures are hosted by specialized companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
    Cloud computing is an infrastructure that offers services where resources can be shared, stored and accessed from anywhere at any time. Amazon itself once said: “Cloud computing offers a way of servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services via the Internet”.
    Cloud-based structures use remote servers, these servers can be anywhere in the world and are used to connect users to the resources offered by the system that is hosted within that infrastructure.
    The main advantages of using these services are quick access to their resources and low cost. The resources of this service are servers, applications, routing equipment, among others. Companies that use this type of service do not need to worry about hardware, software, storage, security, infrastructure, among other things, as the cloud services server itself is in charge of this. With this, the costs of all this infrastructure end up decreasing.
    There are three types of cloud: Public, which is open to companies and people and anyone can use it, either free or paid; Private and designed and operated by a company, being for private use, it has a higher cost but has more security for your data; and Hybrid, which has a mixed use between public and private.
